"""Regression tests for #62365: context compaction must not fabricate user
requests that never happened in the real transcript.

Root cause: the compaction template pushes the LLM into writing
``User asked: '<verbatim quote>'``. When the actual conversation has no
outstanding user request (or the model can't locate one), it fabricates a
quote to fit the template — the next-turn agent then acts on a request
that was never made.

Fix: post-validation helper ``_strip_fabricated_user_asks`` scans every
``User asked: '<quote>'`` line in the LLM's summary and checks whether
the quoted substring appears in user-role source turns. Unverifiable
quotes get rewritten to a safe ``None`` fallback so the agent sees "no
outstanding ask" instead of a fabricated one. On iterative compaction the
previously validated summary is accepted as provenance so a legitimate
prior active task is preserved.
